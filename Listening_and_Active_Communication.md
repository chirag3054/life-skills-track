# Listening and Active Communication

## Active Listening
1. Avoid getting distracted by your own thoughts. Focus on the speaker and topic instead.
2. Try not to interrupt the other person. Let them finish and then respond.
3. Use door openers, that show your are interested and keep the other person talking.
4. Show that you are listening with body language.
5. If appropriate take notes during important conversations.
6. Paraphrase what other have said to make sure you are on the same page.

## Reflective Listening
Reflective listening appears deceptively easy, but it takes practice and skill to do well. In reflective listening, the listener tries to clarify and restate what the other person is saying.

The benefits of reflective listening are that it can:
* Increase the listener's understanding of the other person
* Help the other person clarify their thoughts
* Reassure the other person that someone is willing to attend to their point of view and wants to help them express their thoughts.

The key points of Reflective Listening are as follows:

1. **Attentive Listening:** The listener should focus on the speaker and give them their full attention. This means avoiding distractions, maintaining eye contact, and not interrupting the speaker while they are talking.

2. **Nonverbal Cues:** Nonverbal cues like nodding, smiling, and maintaining an open body posture can encourage the speaker to continue sharing their thoughts and feelings.

3. **Paraphrasing:** After the speaker finishes expressing themselves, the listener paraphrases or summarizes what was said in their own words. This demonstrates that the listener has actively understood the message and provides an opportunity for the speaker to clarify or expand on their thoughts if needed.

4. **Empathy:** Reflective Listening involves showing empathy towards the speaker's emotions and experiences. The listener acknowledges the speaker's feelings and perspectives without judgment.

5. **Validation:** The listener should validate the speaker's feelings and experiences, even if they don't necessarily agree with them. This validation helps build trust and openness in the conversation.

6. **Avoiding Judgment and Advice:** It's essential for the listener to refrain from being judgmental or offering unsolicited advice. Reflective Listening is about creating a safe space for the speaker to express themselves without fear of criticism.

7. **Active Engagement:** The listener actively engages in the conversation, encouraging the speaker to continue sharing their thoughts and emotions.
   
8. **Open-ended Questions:** Using open-ended questions can prompt the speaker to delve deeper into their thoughts and feelings, promoting a more meaningful conversation.

## Obstacles in listening process
**Distractions:** External distractions like noise, interruptions, or a busy environment can make it challenging to focus on what the speaker is saying.

**Preconceived notions:** If the listener has preconceived ideas or biases about the speaker or the topic, they may unintentionally filter or misinterpret the information being shared.

**Selective listening:** Sometimes, individuals may only hear what they want to hear, ignoring or downplaying information that contradicts their beliefs or preferences.

**Lack of attention:** Not paying enough attention to the speaker can lead to misunderstandings and hinder effective communication.

**Emotional state:** Strong emotions, such as anger, sadness, or stress, can affect a person's ability to listen attentively and empathetically.

**Cultural and language barriers:** Differences in cultural backgrounds or language proficiency can create communication barriers and make it difficult to understand the speaker fully.

**Assumptions and jumping to conclusions:** Listeners may jump to conclusions or make assumptions about what the speaker means, without seeking clarification.

**Interrupting:** Interrupting the speaker before they have finished expressing their thoughts can disrupt the flow of communication and make the speaker feel unheard.

**Overthinking:** Overthinking while listening can divert attention away from the speaker's message and lead to misunderstandings.

**Overwhelming amount of information:** When the speaker provides a large amount of information all at once, it can be challenging for the listener to process and retain everything.

**Multitasking:** Trying to do other tasks while listening can divide attention and reduce the listener's ability to comprehend the message fully.

## Improving your listening skills
some strategies to enhance listening abilities:

1. Attention: When someone is speaking, make a conscious effort to focus solely on them. Minimize distractions and put away electronic devices to avoid temptations that may divert your attention.

2. Maintain eye contact: Engaging in eye contact shows the speaker that you are actively listening and interested in what they have to say.

3. Be patient: Allow the speaker to express themselves without interrupting. Avoid finishing their sentences or rushing them to complete their thoughts.

4. Avoid judgment: Be open-minded and non-judgmental when listening to others. Accept their perspectives and feelings even if they differ from your own.

5. Practice empathy: Try to understand the speaker's emotions and experiences from their point of view. Show empathy and acknowledge their feelings.

6. Paraphrase and summarize: After the speaker has finished talking, paraphrase or summarize what they said in your own words. This helps to ensure you understood the message correctly and provides an opportunity for the speaker to clarify any misunderstandings.

7. Limit distractions: Find a quiet and comfortable environment for important conversations, reducing external disturbances that may hinder your ability to focus.

8. Be genuinely interested: Cultivate a sincere interest in others and their stories. When you genuinely care about what someone has to say, your listening skills naturally improve.
