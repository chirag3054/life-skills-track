## steps that can be taken when you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour

Ensure your safety: If you feel immediate danger or threatened, prioritize your safety. Remove yourself from the situation if possible and find a safe space.
Document the incidents: Keep a record of the incidents, including dates, times, locations, descriptions of the behavior, and the individuals involved. This documentation can be helpful if you decide to report the harassment later.
Seek support: Reach out to trusted friends, family members, or colleagues who can provide emotional support and guidance. Sharing your experience can help alleviate any feelings of isolation or self-blame.
Understand your rights and policies: Familiarize yourself with the laws and policies regarding sexual harassment in your specific context, whether it's the workplace, educational institution, or other setting. Know your rights and the procedures for reporting incidents.
Report the harassment: If you feel comfortable and safe doing so, report the incidents to the appropriate authority or entity.

Follow the prescribed reporting procedures and provide them with the documented information.
Seek professional advice: Consider consulting with a lawyer or legal professional who specializes in sexual harassment cases. They can provide guidance on your rights, legal options, and potential courses of action
